You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?

To be honest not a whole lot yet. But that is because I was already familiar with HTML before coming into this course.  
* What has been easy?
  
All of the basic stuff.
* What has been difficult?
Always remembering to use src vs href. I always confuse the two.
  
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I am an avid fan of using stackoverflow. They are great at solving any issue I may have. Basically any problem that I have, especially at this level, has already been asked
and answered on stack overflow!
